Dear Sir/Madam,

I wish to apply for the IT Systems / Security Administration Role.

I have just completed a springboard Diploma in Networking and Systems Security and will graduate with Distinction. During this diploma, I completed modules such as Cyber Security, Routing & Switching, Network Technology & Security, Operating Systems & Virtualization, Data Communications, Wireless & Mobile Networks, Cloud Computing and Strategic Business IT.
</br>
</br>
I am a driven self-starter, passionate about my work and a strong will to succeed. I have completed a variety of short online courses in a diverse range of topics, from programming and excel to law. I completed 120 credits of a L8 Science course at University of Limerick in 2016. I left the course as I was too young at the time to commit to the final two years of the course.
</br>
</br>
Prior to upskilling in Computer Science, I spent three years working in the hospitality sector in France rising to the level of Assistant Manager. Working as part of a team, sometimes in high stress situations, has helped me develop my interpersonal, communication and teamwork skills. Here I also oversaw the IT maintenance (routers, TVâ€™s, iPhones) in the premises as I had a strong aptitude for it.
</br>
</br>
I am not afraid of hard or difficult work. During the French pandemic lockdown, I returned to Ireland in May 2020. When I heard that Castlebar hospital could not get staff to clean the covid wards I phoned the hospital and offered to do the job at a time when few people wanted to even set foot in those wards.
</br>
</br>
I believe I meet the criteria required for an IT Systems / Security Administration Role. I can share with you a portfolio of my course assignments and certificates should you wish to evaluate the quality of my course work.
</br>
</br>
Please read the accompanying CV which will provide you with further details of my skill set and academic qualifications.
</br>
</br>
I appreciate you taking the time to read my application and I look forward to hearing from you.
</br>
</br>
</br>
</br>
Kind Regards,
</br>
Rosie McDonnell
